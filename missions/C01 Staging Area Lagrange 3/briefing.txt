Hello, Player. I'm glad you could finally make it in this morning.
The briefing was scheduled for eight standard minutes ago.
$text_col_2$
Sorry, Ma'am. I've been checking the battle groups trajectories, 
estimated remaining delta V and started pre planing for fuel 
transfers.

Very well then. We'll be starting our deceleration burn in about 
45 minutes. As you're aware, we'll be the first to arrive. Our
recce-probes didn't pick up on any significant enemy presence,
however, there seems to be a lone corvette at the staging area.

A lone corvette, ma'am?
$text_col_1$
We think that the Dawnies moved more ships in from systems 
neighbouring Krig, the corvette was probably lacking delta V
and is waiting to be refueled. We're currently jamming it's 
long range communications, we want you to take it out.

You don't want to board the ship, see what we're up against?

They see a Crayven Command Cruiser, they think taking it down 
with them, is their ticket straight to the pearly gates. I don't 
want to risk the Astrids capabilities this early.

Fair enough. So it's skeet shooting for a warmup, unless it's 
going to run back to it's mama. The corvette's been sitting here 
for a while, hasnt it?
$text_col_1$
We think so. If they're low on fuel, it might give us an advantage 
we usually don't enjoy. And if they've moved in everything they 
have from surrounding systems, one we will need.

Unless they are, once we've announced ourselves, we'll be toast 
pretty quickly, given their expected numerical superiority.

I'm aware Player. Now if you don't have any questions or requests, 
I'll have a staff meeting to attend to.
$text_col_2$
No, Ma'am.
