The Astrid was definatly made for crashing a party, while the wreckage 
of that dawnie corvette slowly drifts out of the gravitational 
equilibrium of the Lagrange point, the first ships assigned to our 
battle group are manouvering into positions around us. After we've 
redistributed our fuel, we should be able to dive into the low krig 
orbit and introduce ourselfes planetside. That is assuming they are 
low on fuel and haven't set up planetary refining yet, if that was 
the case, they'd be able to come after us in force. We wouldn't stand 
a chance. If the strategic analysis is right though, they're still 
lacking in that area, which means, we can use our advantage in reserves, 
to harass them on our terms. The time windows of these drop windows are
going to be short though. They've got to many ships and we're 
bound to slip up and make mistakes. We will loose ships ans ground 
forces at some point.
